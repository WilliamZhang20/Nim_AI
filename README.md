# Nim AI

This repsoitory uses a **reinforcement learning** technique called Q-learning to play a game called [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim).

TLDR: Nim is a two-player game that involves a number of piles of items. Each player has to remove a number of items, which can be any number of items that all have to be from the same pile. Whoever removes the last item loses. 

The idea for this repository came from a Harvard CS50 Introduction to AI with Python course [project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/4/nim/), where the structure of the implementation all comes from.
